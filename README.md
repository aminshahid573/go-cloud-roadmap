- **Reset Progress**: Want to start over? A confirmation-protected "Reset" button lets you clear your progress and begin your journey anew.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

This project is built with a modern frontend stack, emphasizing performance, clean code, and a great developer experience.

- **Frontend**: [React](https://react.dev/) with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- **Animations**: [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)
- **AI Integration**: [Google Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/) (`@google/genai`)
- **Markdown Parsing**: [Marked](https://marked.js.org/)
- **Syntax Highlighting**: [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/)
- **Fun**: [canvas-confetti](https://github.com/catdad/canvas-confetti)

The application is architected as a single-page application with no build step, using modern ES Modules (`importmap`) for fast, on-the-fly dependency management.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To run this project locally, you'll need a modern web browser and a Google Gemini API key.

### Prerequisites

- A Google Gemini API Key. You can get one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
- A local web server to serve the `index.html` file. VS Code's [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension is a great option.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/aminshahid573/go-cloud-roadmap.git
    cd go-cloud-roadmap
    ```

2.  **Set up your API Key:**
    This project expects the API key to be available as an environment variable. Since this is a client-side application, you'll need to create a `process.env.js` file to simulate this.

    Create a new file named `process.env.js` in the root of the project and add the following content, replacing `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual Gemini API key:

    ```javascript
    window.process = {
      env: {
        API_KEY: "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE",
      },
    };
    ```

3.  **Include the environment file in `index.html`:**
    Open `index.html` and add this script tag inside the `<head>` section, _before_ the `importmap` script:

    ```html
    <script src="process.env.js"></script>
    ```

4.  **Run the application:**
    Open the `index.html` file using a local web server (like the VS Code Live Server extension). This is necessary to handle the ES module imports correctly.
